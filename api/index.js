        correctAnswer: "x = 10",
        subtopic: "Variables",
        explanation: "In Python, variables are created by assigning a value using the = operator. You donâ€™t need to declare the type; Python is dynamically typed.",

        options: ["int", "char", "float", "All of the above"],
        correctAnswer: "All of the above",
        subtopic: "Data Types",
        explanation: "Python supports multiple data types, including int, float, str, and many more. Unlike char in other languages, Python represents characters as strings of length 1.",
